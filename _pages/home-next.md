Terminology Infrastructure Management Services (TIMS) promotes parity and interoperability across different contexts for the ontology community and basic clinical research bioinformatics. The TIMS goal is to provide rich OMOP terminology mappings. TIMS hosts a FHIR server that provides ontologies, terminologies, value sets, and SSSOM-formatted mappings. See our service document.
