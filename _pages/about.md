### The TIMS Group
Terminology Infrastructure Management Services (TIMS) promotes parity and interoperability across different contexts for
the ontology community and basic clinical research bioinformatics. We do this mainly through our [open source tools](
/projects/) and [FHIR-based terminology server](/terminology-server/).
