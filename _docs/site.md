title: Contributing to this site and the blog
---

You can contribute to this site by editing various files [here](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tims/tree/gh-pages)

* The top menu is configurable [here](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tims/tree/gh-pages/_data/navigation.yml)
* Additional pages get added [here](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tims/tree/gh-pages/_pages/) but will not show up unless they are linked from somewhere.  There is a way to list all pages, as you can see for the `Documentation` section. This is even more configurable as we develop more pages.
* Posts can be added [here](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tims/tree/gh-pages/_posts/) by following the welcome example, and they will show up on the Blog page.
* You can add additional documentation pages [here](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tims/tree/gh-pages/_docs/) and then add them to the sidebar by editing the `docs` entry [here](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tims/tree/gh-pages/_data/navigation.yml)
